## What is shutil?

shutil is a Python module that provides a higher-level interface for file operations. It offers functions to copy, move,
rename, and delete files and directories in a more user-friendly way compared to the lower-level file operations 
available in the os module.


## Why do we use shutil?

We use shutil in Python for tasks related to file and directory management, such as copying files, moving files between 
directories, archiving directories, and more. It simplifies these operations by providing convenient functions that
handle common file tasks efficiently.


## advantages of shutil?

- Simplified file operations: shutil provides high-level functions that make file operations easier to perform.
- Cross-platform compatibility: shutil functions work consistently across different operating systems.
- Error handling: shutil includes built-in error handling mechanisms for file operations.
- Supports recursive operations: shutil can perform operations on directories and their contents recursively.


## disadvantages of shutil?

- Limited functionality: While shutil covers common file operations, it may not provide all the features needed for complex file management tasks.
- Performance considerations: In some cases, lower-level file operations from the os module may be more efficient than using shutil.
- Dependency on the Python standard library: shutil is part of the Python standard library, so updates or improvements may be tied to Python releases.


## Summary about shutil:

In summary, shutil is a Python module that simplifies file operations by providing high-level functions for tasks like 
copying, moving, and deleting files and directories. It offers advantages such as ease of use, cross-platform 
compatibility, error handling, and support for recursive operations. However, it may have limitations in functionality 
compared to lower-level operations and could have performance considerations in certain scenarios.
