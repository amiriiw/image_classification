## What is OS library?

The OS library in programming refers to the operating system module/library that provides a way to interact with the
operating system. It allows you to perform various operating system-related tasks such as file operations, directory 
operations, process management, and more.


## Why do we use OS library?
    
We use the OS library in programming to access and manipulate operating system functionalities like reading and writing 
files, creating directories, executing system commands, and handling paths.


## advantage of OS library?
    
Advantages of using the OS library include:

- Platform independence: It provides a consistent interface to interact with the underlying operating system, making your code portable across different platforms.


- System-level operations: It allows you to perform low-level system tasks that are not directly available in higher-level programming languages.


## disadvantage of OS library?

Disadvantages of using the OS library may include:

- Platform-specific behavior: Some functions may behave differently on different operating systems, requiring additional handling for cross-platform compatibility.


- Security risks: Performing system-level operations using the OS library may introduce security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.


## Summary about OS library:

In summary, the OS library is a crucial component in programming that enables developers to interact with the operating 
system, perform system-related tasks, and ensure portability and efficiency in their code.
