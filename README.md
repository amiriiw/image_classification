## How you should use the src:
**waring: its good to read the src one time by your self.**

1- at first download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qY25-g_HVWJDs7Lzq5mxdDg50-wbF0Up?usp=sharing

2- after that you should train the dataset in image_classification_model_trainer.py file 
  - point: if you dont have strong system train the model in colab or jupyter.

3- call the function with two params model_name and your imgs path

4- after all steps run the image_classification_app.py file to see how program work.
